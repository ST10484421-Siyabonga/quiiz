This is a link to my youtube video:
The quiz application focuses on bmw car facts. The users can answer the questions by simply clicking the true or fale button
there are 3 screens in this app, the first screen only has a start button. When the user clicks that start button it will 
automatically go to the second screen where another start button is enabled allowing the user to recieve questions and answer them.
The third screen shows the users score, the retry button and an exit button.
